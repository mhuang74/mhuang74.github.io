Looking at the blogging plans I wrote down for 2021, I feel embarassed, and somewhat defeated. What I have learned is this:

* keep working on the *process*. that basically means managing my energy levels by: sleeping earlier (less time reading news); eat light dinner; don't check work email/slack and dive into hobby projects first thing in the morning.

<!-- more -->

* keep *focus*. Only do one thing well per year.

* keep *motivated*. Find people to work with, and also to get some social pressure.

Here's what I wrote down for 2021 back in Oct 2020. 

__2021 Article List__

* Microcontroller. Preferrably related to TinyML.
* Donkeycar. Preferrably using above microcontroller to navigate.
* Web Analytics. Provide Google Analytics setup/analysis for non-profits.
* Machine Learning. Anomaly detection areas.


My list for 2021 was too broad, and each area I dabbled in wasn't deep enough to write about. So for 2022, I would like to keep a narrow focus.

__2022 Focus: Rust and Google Ads__
* Q1: Challenges with building a Google Ads GAQL CLI with Rust gRPC
* Q2: Generating Google Ads Dashboard with Rust Static Site Generator Zola
* Q3: Google Ads performance anamoly detection with Rust
* Q4: Bonus article

With a concrete schedule set, lets see how I fare this year.
